# Scripts Directory

## Overview
This directory contains Python scripts for implementing the project's functionality.

## Structure
- `README.md`: This file explains the purpose and contents of the `scripts/` directory.
- `preprocessing/`: Scripts for data cleaning and feature engineering.
- `supervised_learning/`: Scripts for classification tasks.
- `unsupervised_learning/`: Scripts for clustering tasks.
- `language_models/`: Scripts for natural language processing (NLP) experiments.
- `utils/`: Utility scripts for shared functionality.

## Script Categories
### Preprocessing
- **Purpose**: Data cleaning, feature extraction, and transformations.
- Example: `preprocess_data.py` to convert raw data into processed datasets.

### Supervised Learning
- **Purpose**: Train and evaluate classifiers.
- Example: `train_classifier.py` to train machine learning models.

### Unsupervised Learning
- **Purpose**: Implement clustering algorithms.
- Example: `cluster_sessions.py` for k-means clustering.

### Language Models
- **Purpose**: Experiment with advanced NLP techniques.
- Example: `run_language_model.py` to fine-tune BERT for SSH commands.

### Utilities
- **Purpose**: Helper functions for data manipulation, logging, and evaluation.
- Example: `helpers.py` for reusable code.

## Usage
Run scripts directly using Python. Example:
```bash
python scripts/preprocessing/preprocess_data.py
```
